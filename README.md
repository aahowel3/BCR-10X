# 10X Based B-cell Immune Profiling in UFC RSV-F Trimer Immunized Mouse Splenic Cells

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant contributor to cases of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) and primarily affects young children and the elderly (Nam and Ison, [2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31506273/); Branche and Falsey, [2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25851217/); Shi et al., [2017](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00478-0/fulltext); Savic et al., [2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36369772/)). Worldwide, an estimated 3.2 million hospitalizations and 118,2000 deaths were attributed to RSV in children under 5 years of age in 2015 (Shi et al., [2017](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00478-0/fulltext)), and in 2019 there were approximately 470,000 RSV-related hospitalizations and 33,000 in-hospital deaths globally due to RSV in adults older than 60 (Savic et al., [2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36369772/)). Therefore, the development of an RSV vaccine is of critical importance to global health. Here, we present a 10X Genomics based protocol for isolating and single-cell sequencing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) after immunization with an uncleaved prefusion-closed (UFC) trimer of the RSV F protein (Lee et al., [2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38496645/)) in order the evaluate the vaccineâ€™s ability to induce robust antibody responses with high neutralizing titers.

Download taxdb.btd, taxdb.bti, taxdb.tar.gz from https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/taxdb.tar.gz <br />
Prepare rank-biased overlap blast results via `phirbo_preprocessing.txt` <br />
Run phribo by providing two input directories (i.e., for phages [`phage_virusblast/`] and bacteria [`phage_hostblast/`]) containing ranked lists from blast output, and an output file name (`phage_phirbo/predictions.csv`) <br />
